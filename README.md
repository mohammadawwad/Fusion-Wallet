# Fusion-Wallet
A Web 3.0 NFT project that runs off of Meta Mask 
I have developed it using Solidity smart contract, along side JavaScript and React.

the project allows you to send an amount of Ethereum to anyone through the ethereum blockchain and send a random generated NFT to the reciever based off the keyword of your choice.

important sites for development include:
  -Alchemy
  -Ropsten Fauset 
  -Etherscan
  
 
T run the project go into shell and go into the client directory
`cd ./client`

Then type `npm run dev` to start the project on your local machine
